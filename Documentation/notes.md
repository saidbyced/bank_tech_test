Input/output table completed - IMG_0069.jpg

Ruby module that can be used from IRB directly. Functions look like 'deposit(something)' instead of 'account123.deposit(something)'. This is so that it can be required into a account controller if necessary.

Three functions:
- deposit e.g. deposit(1000)
- withdraw e.g. withdraw(500)
- print statement e.g. print_statement
